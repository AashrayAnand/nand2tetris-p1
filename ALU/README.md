# HDL-ALU

An arithmetic logic unit, implemented in the HDL hardware description language (for nand2tetris).

The ALU supports a set of 18 functions, which are specified by 6 input bits, these operations include

* bitwise logical operators (e.g. bitwise AND/OR)
* arithmetic operations (e.g. X + Y, X - Y)

The ALU returns the function output, as well as 2 output bits which describe the result of the computation.
