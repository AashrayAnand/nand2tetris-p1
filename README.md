# NAND2TETRIS - part 1

This repository include the materials for part 1 of the nand2tetris online course, a computer science
curriculum which focuses on a comprehensive understanding of computer systems, by implementing an entire
functioning computer, beginning only with a NAND logical gate primitive, and successively iterating through
each layer of abstraction, ranging from:

* logic gates
* memory units
* machine language
* assembler
* compiler
* basic OS

This repository includes the implementation of the underlying computer architecture, including all necessary
logic gates, RAM units, an arithmetic logic unit, and a CPU.
